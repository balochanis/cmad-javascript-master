1) while ( x = 0 ; x <10 ; x++ )
console.log(x);

2) var x = 0;
	while(){
	console.log("here");
	x++;	
	}

3) do-while would execute its statements at least
once, even if the condition fails for the first time.
Is above statement correct?

4) var i = 0;
do{ 
console.log( "Hello there \n") ;

}while ( i < 4 ) ;

5) var i = 0;
do{ 
console.log( "Hello there \n") 
};while ( i < 4 ) ;
